		After adding Absinthe, Cognac or Rye Whisky can be added as a second alcoholic ingredient. Originally in New Orleans during the mid-19th Century Cognac was typically used in Sezeracs. However, the 1880s phylloxera epidemic led to a decline in European wine production, causing cognac imports to the Unites States to decline leading to locally available Rye Whisky being commonly used instead. One hundred and forty years later the choice of whisky or cognac is up to you.

		Adding Rye Whisky will give your Sezerac a spicier flavour, it is often considered to be more grainy and dry than Bourbon. In the US by law Rye Whisky must contain at least 51 per cent rye. Few producers survived prohibition and the drink went into decline for many decades. More recently Rye has undergone a small revival and is now easier to get hold of.

		If the taste of Rye is too harsh then Cognac will make a Sezerac smoother. The exact taste of a Cognac depends on the grapes it is made from, but in general it is sweeter than whisky with hints of dried fruit. The name comes from the French town where it was first made. Cognac is a type of brandy made near the west coast of France. During its production a dry and acidic white wine is doubly distilled and aged in oak casks for at least two years.
