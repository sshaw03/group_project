		<h3> 
		The bitters, sugar and lemon zest are not often the first thing one thinks of when thinking of a Sazarac, and are outshone by its more glamourous ingredients. Bitters, a sugar cube and a a tiny amount of lemon zest really make this classic New Orleans cocktail what it is.

		Peychauds Bitters, has a fascinating History, banned during Prohibition, Peychauds was developed by an apothecary of Creole descent, Antoine Peychauds using a recipes passed down to him by his Haitian father. Made using Gentian Root, this is a slightly sweeter and more floral bitters than others on the market such as Angostura. There is of course always much discusion about exact measurements but i recommend 4 dashes in 2oz of Whiskey.

		Whilst not traditional, it has become popular to add a dash of Angostura a Bitters more herbal in flavour to the mix. Although I wouldn't recommend anymore than that. Whilst also made of Gentian Root, it packs a punch at 47.7% alc/vol.

	<h2>
		The Sugar Cube
	</h2>
	<img src="Images/sugar2.jpg">
	<p>
		Sugar has been produced in the Indian subcontinent since ancient times. It was not plentiful or cheap in early times and honey was more often used for sweetening in most parts of the world. Sugar was a luxury in Europe until the 18th century, when it became more widely available. It then became popular and by the 19th century, sugar came to be considered a necessity. Sugar cubes (sometimes called sugar lumps) are white or brown granulated sugars lightly steamed and pressed together in block shape. They can also be produced to contain reduced sugar content through a special production process.

	<h2>
		Lemon Zest
	</h2>

	<p>
		The origin of the lemon is unknown, though lemons are thought to have first grown in Assam (a region in northeast India), northern Burma or China. Lemons entered Europe near southern Italy no later than the second century AD, during the time of Ancient Rome. The first substantial cultivation of lemons in Europe began in Genoa in the middle of the 15th century. The lemon was later introduced to the Americas in 1493 when Christopher Columbus brought lemon seeds to Hispaniola on his voyages. Spanish conquest throughout the New World helped spread lemon seeds. It was mainly used as an ornamental plant and for medicine. In the 19th century, lemons were increasingly planted in Florida and California. Zest is used in some cocktails not only for flavor and aroma but also for color as a garnish. For use as a cocktail garnish, zest often is cut in a long spiral called a twist.
