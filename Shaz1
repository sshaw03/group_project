		The sweet, the sour and the bitters
	</h1>

		<p> 
		The bitters, sugar and lemon zest are not often the first thing one thinks of when thinking of a Sazarac, and are outshone by its more glamourous ingredients. Bitters, a sugar cube and a a tiny amount of lemon zest really make this classic New Orleans cocktail what it is.

		Peychauds Bitters, has a fascinating History, banned during Prohibition, Peychauds was developed by an apothecary of Creole descent, Antoine Peychauds using a recipes passed down to him by his Haitian father. Made using Gentian Root, this is a slightly sweeter and more floral bitters than others on the market such as Angostura. There is of course always much discusion about exact measurements but i recommend 4 dashes in 2oz of Whiskey.

		Whilst not traditional, it has become popular to add a dash of Angostura a Bitters more herbal in flavour to the mix. Although i wouldn't recommend anymore than that. Whilst also made of Gentian Root, it packs a punch at 47.7% alc/vol.
